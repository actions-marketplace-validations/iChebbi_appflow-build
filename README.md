> For the action to work you will need to [connect your Appflow app to GitHub](https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow/quickstart/github) in the Appflow dashboard.

The action can build iOS & Android binaries for Capacitor & Cordova apps using Appflow from any type of runner.
You can easily use the [Appflow Dashboard](https://dashboard.ionicframework.com) to setup your application and use this
action to run you builds & upload them as artifacts to GitHub.

See [action.yml](action.yml) for the full documentation for this action's inputs and outputs.

> You can learn more about how to configure your build in the [Appflow docs](https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow)

## Authentication

You will need a token to authenticate with Appflow.
The easiest way to get your token is to use the Ionic CLI to login & retrieve the token.

To login type:

```bash
npm i -g @ionic/cli
ionic login
```

Then you can use the following command to see your token:

```bash
ionic config get -g tokens.user
```

Prevent the CLI from invalidating the token:

```bash
ionic config unset -g tokens.refresh
ionic config unset -g tokens.user
```
